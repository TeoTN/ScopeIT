Information Technology labour market is quite distinct from others in terms of how people tend to seek for a job. Position requirements for a programmer are often very concise and precise, therefore it is feasible to quantify the skills and requirements an applicant has.
In recent years, a handful of job searching websites dedicated solely to programmers emerged on the internet and presented rather unique approach to filtering jobs. It is now preferable to put emphasis on programming languages, technologies, libraries and frameworks which are involved in the post, rather than let users search by keywords and skim through a block of text within the offer.
