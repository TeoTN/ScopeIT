The Stable Matching problem is occurs in a number of disciplines, including mathematics, economics and computer science. The earliest known matching scheme originated in 1952, when National Resident Matching Program was launched in United States, in order to provide reliable and fair method of matching graduating medical students to their first hospital assignments. \cite{nrmp}
